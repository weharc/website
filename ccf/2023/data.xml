An annual production of original sketch comedy and parody song, Law Revue pulls apart the seams of our legal, cultural, personal, and political worlds, and turns them into a radically funny, searingly honest night of comedy. Written and performed by students from any degree they keep the weird name 'law revue' out of laziness and an attempt to impress people at parties. The sketches may be relatable, random, raunchy or anywhere in between but rest assured it is funny!

<showDescription>Chris is never more busy than when she has to do her tax. That's when she inspects her lounge room, picking up large crumbs by hand, asking what is the key to happiness? What's the difference between a good decision and a phase? Why do women now have the eyelashes of a camel? Chris has moved, physically and metaphorically, so there's a bit going on. Thoughts will be served with signature dry snark, targeting those who deserve it.

No story, no thru-line (cowards), just Frankie McNair screaming her favourite jokes for 55minutes and having too much fun in a grubby mix of stand-up, non sequitur sketch comedy and unbridled joy (*chef's kiss*)

Despite recently winning “Best Newcomer” at the 2022 Melbourne International Comedy Festival and the cult success of their alt comedy show Emma's Debutante (an absurd comedy line up show created by Frankie McNair and Emma Holland which received rave reviews and a sold-out season at the 2021 Melbourne International Comedy Festival) Frankie's mum still frequently asks if they need money. They do 🙂

She's made self-improvements, been the victim of a subpar prank, learned loads about sperm whales, and now she's bursting to share it all!

Notorious for her feel-good outlook, Webeck's crafted another hilarious upbeat hour, so take a break from the doom scrolling, drag yourself away from Netflix, and join your new bestie for a bit of fun!

As seen on ABC's Question Everything, Channel 10's Just For Laughs Australia TV Gala and the Melbourne International Comedy Festival Gala

Webeck is a perfect choice. You would need a heart of concrete not to be won over by her sunny affability, which pours out of her at the same rate as her one-liners, both on and off the stage. The Age, 2021</showDescription>

<artistName>Melanie Bracewell</artistName><showTitle>Ooh La La</showTitle><artistImage>unnamed-file-28</artistImage><artistImageType>jpeg</artistImageType><showDescription>Hello! This is Melanie Bracewell. From the telly and your dreams.
The show is about desperately trying to be remembered, love, and eggs. I'd love to see you there.

Okay, I'm done; here are some of my achievements:

Melanie is just 27 years old and taking the comedy world by storm.

The Kiwi won the prestigious Best Newcomer award for her first solo show at the NZ International Comedy Festival. With goofy observations and natural stage charisma, Melanie is a master of anecdotes. In 2018, Melanie won the famed Billy T Award; in 2019, she performed as part of the invite-only Just For Laughs Comedy Festival at the Sydney Opera House, and in 2021 she won the coveted Directors' Choice Award at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.

And she only got busier, co-hosting 'The Cheap Seats', which has just been renewed for 2023 and making regular appearances on 'Have you Been Paying Attention?' in Australia and New Zealand. When she's not on stage, Melanie is a social media powerhouse. Whether she's filming content for her TikTok channel, which has over eight million likes, writing for the more than 250,000 followers of her meladoodle.tumblr.com blog or desperately trying to get her jokes down to 140 characters for her slightly less popular Twitter profile, @meladoodle, Melanie has social media covered. Her tweets have been featured on Buzzfeed, Playboy (the funny parts not the nude parts) and the New York Times.

If you need further convincing – DM me your phone number on socials and I'll call you, and work through any objections you might have. I check my direct messages every day or two, so it might take up to 48 hours. But I will call. On a blocked number. Answer the call.

Fire Brand is the story of Nick's attempts to capture the fading memories of his childhood home using only the unlikely collection of items that survived the blaze. This is a tale of Captain America, Canesten antifungal cream and some very overcooked chips.

<artistName>Sarah Ison and Laura Johnston</artistName><showTitle>Would We Lie to You</showTitle><artistImage>unnamed-file-38</artistImage><artistImageType>jpeg</artistImageType><showDescription>From gaslightees to gaslighters. Standup comedian Sarah Ison and sketch artist extraordinaire Laura Johnson present Would We Lie to You and pose the ultimate question: “Seriously, would we?”
You'll have to just take your best guess as this comedy duo bring you sketches featuring scenarios and characters that are either based on real-life-can't-believe-this-happened experiences or are completely fabricated. Made up. Hoax.

Hot off directing the 50th ever ANU Law Revue, Laura is one of Canberra's premier sketch artists and has taken the comedy scene by storm with her musical genius that touches on tough topics like; remembering that guy's name who you've kind of been almost dating for a few weeks now.

Sarah is an ACT Raw Comedy finalist who toured to Adelaide Fringe with her half-sketch, half-stand up comedy show Growing Pains in 2022. When she's not gallivanting on stage, she's a journalist who's featured on the Insiders' couch.</showDescription>

<artistName>Schalk Bezuidenhout</artistName><showTitle>Feeling Good</showTitle><artistImage>unnamed-file-39</artistImage><artistImageType>jpeg</artistImageType><showDescription>Schalk Bezuidenhout is in Australia for the first time ever! Probably a good thing that he has delayed it all these years, because now he is stronger, funnier, and has a thicker moustache. When we say 'stronger' we mean mentally. Physically he still has the body of a very tall 10 year old. For Schalk's first time in the land down under he wrote a show. A very, very funny show. Come join Schalk for an evening of comedy. This might be his funniest show yet. Because, more than ever, he is Feeling Good.

In this classic man and mic hour of stand-up comedy, Schalk Bezuidenhout is a healthy dose of 90s nostalgia and hilarity with a uniquely South African lens.</showDescription>

Shit-Faced Shakespeare is the hilarious blend of an entirely serious Shakespeare play with an entirely shit-faced actor. What could possibly go right? With a genuinely inebriated cast member each night, no two shows are ever the same in this raucous, riotous, rampage through Shakespeare's most iconic play.

After their highly successful Melbourne comedy festival season, with 19 sold-out shows, Sit on my face: an Intimate night with The Harry Morrissey Official is back for ONE NIGHT ONLY Canberra.

Sit on My Face is 60 minutes of intimate, up-close and personal time with The Harry Morrissey Official. Harry delves into the concepts of gender and masculinity with an overarching focus on feminism; A fuse of dance, comedy and drag for short attention spans, peppered with endearing home video archives throughout. It's extra, OTT,camp, kitch and kooky.

Harry is a passionate performer using their work to encourage understanding, equality and community. They work hard to foster a safe and inclusive space when performing and as a result, the energy in the room is fire.

Harry Morrissey is a NATIONAL TREASURE. I laughed, I cried, I was moved – never have I been more enticed to sit on the face of a 6”4 goddess and their brilliant mind.” – Clementine Ford</showDescription>

Cashman will bring his appropriately titled Graphs to Canberra. It features, surprisingly, graphs, stories of being recruited for reality TV, letters from crazy neighbours and more graphs.

Imagine a line graph where the X-axis is time. The Y-axis? Your happiness. The red line (which represents you, whoever's reading this, not coming to the show) is flat. The blue line (you coming to the show) skyrockets whenever you attend. Visualise the blue line rising, and the red line (boring) not moving at all. If we've learned anything over the past few years, it's not to argue with the data.

“Tom Cashman is one of the most delightfully watchable comics I have seen.”

– Kate Copstick, The Scotsman

“Cashman navigates the awkward and downright hilarious with the poise of a seasoned professional.”

<artistName>Diff'ring Strokes</artistName><showTitle>Diff'ring Strokes</showTitle><artistImage>unnamed-file-1</artistImage><artistImageType>jpeg</artistImageType><showDescription>Witness the Diff'ring Strokes of Canberra's most promising young comics!
Anneli Cole mixes comedy and personal introspection so well that it can seem like an overshare, but that depends on who's asking. Her comedy is a relatable dive into living adult life with the angst of childhood ideals.
Please also welcome to your evening Danyal Diallo A.K.A Mr. Yaldiallo – A young veteran of clubs and colleges all over, Danyal is considered one of the more Twisted comics working today.
When not performing comedy, Fateh Singh likes to write poetry, play the bass and practice pronouncing his first name. A pontificator of the digital world, he has the YouTube equivalent of a Philosophy degree and the Facebook equivalent of a social life.
Jeff Shen is crazy enough to go from being employed to unemployable; he left his investment banking job behind because he thought bankers could do better at being funny than being wealthy. He's now finding out the truth the hard way.
Alessandro Oliveira's unique blend of observational comedy, interspersed with unflinching self-deprecation, almost makes his dysfunctional childhood worth it… almost. If you've ever said, “there's no such thing as a stupid question”, prepare to be surprised.</showDescription>

Suma Iyer is preoccupied with the minutiae of everyday life that borders on unhealthy. She isn't afraid to take her obsession to weird places, including her cats' love lives, mattress ghosts, and the emancipatory potential of detachable showerheads.

Jeffrey Charles is a Canberra based musical comedian who has performed before sold out audiences across Sydney and Canberra. His self deprecating songs make you laugh and maybe cry (for the right reasons).</showDescription>

Cy Fahey (Dja Dja Wurrung): What do you get when you have an aboriginal born in Malaysia that looks like a wog? Cy Fahey! Who is as weird and eclectic as his sense of humour.

You shouldn't come to this show if you refer to something you've done as an epic journey despite going nowhere, you have more than one middle name, you know your own I.Q., a NO SHIRT NO SERVICE sign applies to you, you think sweet potato fries were a good invention, if more than one person (excluding your spouse or parents) has called you an idiot recently, or you consider yourself an aficionado of stand up comedy (this includes any Australian man who wears a scarf).

If you're now thinking: Well what about Doctor Who? then don't come.
If someone is dragging you along to this show against your will and you don't have the fortitude to tell them you'd rather go see something more familiar, then file a complaint once you get home and are sitting safely in your study nook.

No lowbreeds please.

<artistName>The Reunion Tour</artistName><showTitle>The Reunion Tour</showTitle><artistImage>unnamed-file-40</artistImage><artistImageType>jpeg</artistImageType><showDescription>Meet Caitlin Maggs, who has wowed audiences with her natural talent from the moment she stepped onto the stage and was beamed out onto National television after winning RAW comedy in Canberra in 2020. And yes, you read that correctly, women can be comedians too. Joined by Scott Hawkins who was thinking about riding one of those scooters you see around town all the way to Goulburn, probably two to be safe, one for each side. And for the love of all that is holy, keep those purple ones away #TeamOrangeScooter. Their buddy Wen Su is currently a failure, according to his mum, both in becoming a doctor (the other kind) and as a stand-up comedian. By performing at the show, Wen seeks to make his family proud again. Well, you will be the judge of that. And 19 year old newcomer, Ethan Kirk isn't old enough to have attended any sort of reunion – but he hopes it'll be a lot of fun! His unique comedic perspective has taken him across Australia, including the Melbourne Comedy Festival as a Class Clowns National Finalist. What he lacks in life experience, he is sure to make for with big laughs!</showDescription>

<showTitle>... just add estrogen</showTitle><artistImage>unnamed-file-46</artistImage>
<artistImageType>jpeg</artistImageType>
<showDescription>One year after sold out shows at the 2022 Canberra Comedy Festival, The Women's Room 2 is back because they have more to say. From swagging and swearing to swigging champagne, the famous four are back. Trish Hurley, former nurse, is now a self-diagnosed hypochondriac. Jacqui Richards still a grieving widow and now an empty nester who is just not getting enough attention. Midwife Sarah Stewart has been bending, pulling and digging this time in the garden not the birthing room. Tanya Losanno has been busy caring for her parents and her children and marrying people in her spare time. She is still researching whether the Tim Tam or the Mint Slice is the better biscuit. This year's show is being MC'd by Sue Stanic. Sue has been performing comedy since 2018, and is undoubtedly one of the funniest middle-aged women in Belconnen (that we know of). Sue enjoys short walks along the beach, cynicism, and avoiding personal growth.</showDescription>

<showDescription>
Actor, writer, and exceptional storyteller, Rob Carlton (Paper Giants' Kerry Packer, Underbelly, Chandon Pictures, A Moody Christmas) is reliving four true stories that made him the confused, but happy, man he is today.

Sexual taboos, whopping lies, deep heartaches, and blind hope – Rob takes us on a roller coaster word journey that would have made a better man wise. Instead, they've just left Rob CLEARLY CONFUSED.

Audiences will leave feeling a little bit in love with the world in which we live. They'll have laughed and cried and laughed again, and they'll know they're not alone.

Story 1: It's a gathering of the tribe – it's Gran Gran's last Christmas. But two of the cousins let their 'feelings' get the better of them.

Story 2: After telling a lie that gets him flown across the world and onto a film set as a continuity expert, Rob must learn this highly skilled profession from a book… on the plane on the way there.

Story 3: After the passing of his father, Rob sets out on a bike ride… with his dad on his back.

Story 4: Searching for a mid-career pivot, Rob steps into the highly competitive world of musical theatre ­– but can he sing?

‘After defeat, re-enchantment is necessary’, said Lola Olufemi.

This thought inspires Josie Long’s brand new hour of stand-up infused with humanity, compassion and probably some brief political rants.

The triple Edinburgh Comedy Award nominee, underdog Fringe hero and delirious new mother (the first person to have two babies) returns with a show about the changes wrought by time, passion, moving to Scotland and loving the world under – let’s face it – difficult circumstances.

<showDescription>
Michelle is on a plane, watching a documentary about pandas, trying to solve a mystery. In 2020, at Lido cinema, Michelle was handed an envelope with her name on it containing $10.50 in mostly coins. But it wasn’t for her. Legacy is the search for another Michelle Brasier and the exploration of all the other women one woman could have been if she’d made different choices. Reaching out to strangers isn’t always a good idea but Michelle has made lots of mistakes on the internet before. She might as well keep going. It’s about sliding doors, the myth of Narcissus and building a legacy, whatever that is. Can women really have it all? Is it a good idea to fly United Airlines? Will the $10.50 make it to it’s rightful owner?
