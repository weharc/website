      <showDescription>Anthony is a private person, but he's never too far from a stage – if there's attention to be had, he wants it! While we're being honest, he also flirts with wait-staff – but it's because he's about to eat, or has just eaten – which is the greatest time of the day! You know what? It's actually none of your business.&#xD;
&#xD;
Anthony has performed in sell-out Festival shows all around the country over the past few years, and is thrilled to be bringing his third Canberra solo offering in a row with 'Otherwise private'. If you enjoy storytelling, observations, self-deprecation, hot-takes, act-outs, goofs, some absurdity, you won't want to miss this!&#xD;

      <showDescription>Still reeling from being called 'ma'am' while purchasing a packet of hot Cheetos and a maxibon at the local convenience store, I was reminded that I had to come up with a title and blurb for this year's show. 'Urgh it truly is hard being a woman in comedy' I thought, sucking the Cheetos dust off my ring finger and thumb. Anyway, I wrote most of these jokes in my head whilst sitting at the pub being lectured to about data mining by a guy with stick 'n' poke tattoo and bad breath. I think it's a good show, please don't come if your favourite comedian is Stephen Fry or if you quote-tweet things with 'let this sink in'. I'm a stupid bitch and I've never pretended to be otherwise.&#xD;

When Carl was a small boy at school, he asked the teacher how Ants feel. He never got an answer all those years ago, but he still wants to know.&#xD;
&#xD;
Voted number one comedian two years running, come along and see Carl's brand new show – Skating Rink for Flies. A night where he ponders things we all think about but never mention. Things like plastic bags, peanut butter and the possible emotions of an ant.&#xD;
&#xD;
 There is no point to this show other than to make you laugh as much as possible. Funny stories from a bloke with a funny head. What more could you ask for.&#xD;

      <artistImageType>jpg</artistImageType>
      <showDescription>Every ticket includes a glass of wine from one of our local supporting wineries.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ever wondered what wine goes best with Fairy Bread? Why hasn't the 'Champagne Spider' caught on? These questions and many more will be inadequately answered by the self-styled sommeliers of comedy, Damian Callinan &amp;amp; Paul Calleja.&#xD;
&#xD;
After intoxicating sold out audiences across the country, The Wine Bluffs are here to do what they do best: bullshit about wine. Laying spurious claim to a reputation as renowned wine consultants, the duo, fresh from judging the Fruit Wine Section at The Rockhampton Show, will take you through the cellar door experience with a comedic twist.&#xD;
&#xD;
They'll help you match wine to Chiko Rolls, translate over-written bottle blurbs and identify the biggest Wine Wanker in the room: if you have a wine fridge set on two temperatures… It's probably you.&#xD;
&#xD;
The union of Callinan [Melbourne Fringe Comedy winner &amp;amp; 3 time Barry Award Nominee] &amp;amp; Calleja [stand up &amp;amp; writer on Before The Game &amp;amp; countless other TV shows] has everyone's palate salivating as they prepare to uncork their latest vintage and let the comedy breathe.&#xD;
&#xD;
Press Quotes:&#xD;

&#xD;
'Damian Callinan and Paul Calleja have hit on a winning formula with The Wine&#xD;
Bluffs, a stand-up show that lovingly lampoons wine snobbery.' ★★★★ – Artshub&#xD;

      <artistImageType>jpg</artistImageType>
      <showDescription>Hughesy is the busiest man in show business, regularly hosting his own TV and radio shows. It's a known fact that the very best way to see Hughesy is when he's touring live shows to every corner of the continent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Whether he's on tour in Mackay, or unmasking a pirate prawn, there is one guarantee, what he sees along the way is ridiculous.&#xD;
&#xD;
“A sure bet for a belly laugh and a good night out.” ★★★★ The Advertiser, 2019&#xD;
“It's comedy law: if Hughesy says it — with that distinctive bogan drawl of his — it's funny.” Herald Sun, 2019&#xD;

Comedians Glenn Robbins and Dave O'Neil are given two seemingly random topics.&#xD;

Together they have to work out how these very different things are SOMEHOW RELATED.&#xD;
&#xD;
What is the connection between Nazis and Fanta? Napoleon and Kangaroos? JFK and corsets?&#xD;

They are all Somehow Related.</showDescription>

&#xD;
Jack Wright has performed at the Sydney Comedy store, Sydney Fringe and Comedy Festivals, was a Raw Comedy finalist and selected to be part of the 2019 “Breakout Showcase”&#xD;
&#xD;
Canberra's favourite son Dave Henning is moderately less successful but has performed at the Edinburgh, Sydney and Brisbane Fringe Festivals and is genuinely happy for Jack.&#xD;
&#xD;
They've decided to put on a comedy show. Will they achieve comedic distinction?&#xD;
&#xD;
Or will they do all the work at the last minute and receive nothing more than an artist pass?&#xD;
&#xD;
Come laugh with them. Or at them. They can't tell the difference.</showDescription>

      <showDescription>The literal translation of 'Jayasinha' is 'Victorious Lion'.&#xD;
It's a name befitting of a leader or a king. It's a name with swagger. But is it suitable for Dilruk?&#xD;
&#xD;
Dil's certainly had a victorious year, performing sell out shows around the country and the world. Including the invite-only Just For Laughs festival in Montreal. He's been on shows like Have You Been Paying Attention? and Utopia. But he still doesn't feel like the triumphant king of the animal kingdom his name suggests.&#xD;
&#xD;
It's time for Dilruk to work out if he is a Victorious Lion by nature or by name only.</showDescription>

      <showDescription>The quiz show that asks who knows whom, who knows what, because who knows why? Four comedians are pitted against each other in a game of bluff and storytelling, answering questions about their favourite subject matter – themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
From digging deep into contestants' social media footprint to exploring embarrassing school stories, it is always a hilarious and educational look back on guests' pasts to stories they sometimes want to forget.&#xD;
&#xD;
A hugely popular podcast with over a million and a half downloads it has hosted Australia's best comedians such as Hamish and Andy, Hannah Gadsby, Tom Gleeson, Celia Pacquola, Wil Anderson and Judith Lucy as well as international guests like The Dollop, James Acaster, Des Bishop, Jason Byrne and Rose Matafeo.&#xD;

Comedy is like one of those old-fashioned washing machines with the wringers on top. Frank loves to push any topic or tale into the wringers and squeeze as much laughter out as he can. Occasionally he pushes a little enthusiastically and gets his fingers mangled, but that can happen.&#xD;
&#xD;
A brand new stand-up comedy show from the master of daft.&#xD;

Frankie McNair has spent her life trying to prove she isn't dumb…but what happens when she embraces her true calling? An emotional homecoming where you forget the key and have to climb in through the bathroom window.&#xD;
&#xD;
After her sold out run of her debut show Frantasia at Canberra Comedy Festival 2019 and knock out run at Melbourne Fringe Festival, Frankie McNair is back with her biggest, dumbest, and most heart-warming show yet.&#xD;

Following a breakthrough year in 2019 Geraldine is proving to everyone, including herself, that life begins at 40. Deadpan and bang on. Smart, observational comedy has never been so funny and frank.&#xD;

&#xD;
As one the country's top musical comedians, he has the ability to take you on a delightful journey from world class song writing to the cheekier-side of profanities.&#xD;
&#xD;
Hamish's music is clever, simple, poignant and everything non-pc, leaving audiences wanting more and singing his ridiculously ear worming lyrics for days.&#xD;
&#xD;
His refreshingly honest persona, musicality and hilarious take on life culminate in a show not to be missed.</showDescription>

      <artistImageType>jpg</artistImageType>
      <showDescription>Mistakes, failures, errors of judgement, wrongful outcomes and painful conclusions – we've all made them. UK comedian Jeff Green is an expert. Fortunately for us Jeff is also a world class stand-up comic whose skill is to catalogue and retell those personal stories we'd rather file under the heading 'shame and embarrassment' and turn them into a hilarious new show.&#xD;
&#xD;
Never one to hide his mistakes (or learn from them) Jeff has for 30 years been entertaining audiences all over the world with his shortcomings. Coming from a country that celebrates and applauds the plucky loser, Jeff's shows are told not for the learning but for the shared pleasure of failing.&#xD;
&#xD;
Award-winning comedian, best-selling author and ratings-topping radio host Jeff Green is back with a brand-new hour of quick-fire jokes, hilarious stories and relatable mishaps to give audiences a thunderous belly-laugh once more. With a solo West-End season and three full length TV comedy specials under his belt, the hugely in-demand Brit is now based in Melbourne with an Aussie wife, two kids and a couple of cats to provide Jeff with endless comedy fodder.&#xD;
&#xD;
Don't miss the indefatigable Jeff Green as he returns to the Festival with a brand-new show. Book now!&#xD;

      <showDescription>A man (Josh) talks for almost an hour to an audience (you). He'll probably be wearing a stripy t-shirt.&#xD;
&#xD;
Josh Earl is an award-winning comedian who has hosted for TV, radio and now the very popular podcast Don't You Know Who I Am? Josh Earl Talks tells the true story of how Josh, up until the age of 12, struggled with talking and being understood which resulted in a lot of money being spent on speech therapy. And now he talks for a living. Where is his Australian Story?&#xD;
&#xD;
In a first for Josh this show is just him talking. No guitar, no singing, no music. Just Josh and the funniest hour of stories he has.&#xD;

      <artistImage>KIRSTY-960x576</artistImage>
      <artistImageType>jpg</artistImageType>
      <showDescription>Kirsty Webeck is the kind of person that misadventure follows around. Despite her best efforts&#xD;
to lead a peaceful existence, emergencies and drama just have a way of finding her. This is&#xD;
great for her comedy career, but it's a real drain on the public health insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
Gosh! takes you through these antics. Not all of them, because no one wants to sit through a 15&#xD;
hour show, but enough of them to make you either wish you'd been along for the ride or grateful&#xD;
that you weren't.&#xD;
&#xD;
Among other things, Gosh! explains how one goes from making mashed potatoes for dinner to&#xD;
being in a hospital emergency room, in a foreign country and in a foreign language, in the short&#xD;
span of 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
“Webeck is a snappily-dressed tornado of light and positivity. Her shows feel less like formal&#xD;
stand-up and more like an hour-long hug from an old friend. Incredibly funny, incredibly smart,&#xD;
and most of all, incredibly, incredibly good at what she does. The good gear.” Pedestrian&#xD;
&#xD;
“Whenever Kirsty Webeck begins to tell you a story you're never quite sure how it's going to turn&#xD;
out, but one thing is certain: it's going to get weird. Not weird in the 'freak out' way but weird in&#xD;
the “it could only happen to Kirsty” way.” ~ My Melbourne Arts</showDescription>

      <artistImageType>jpg</artistImageType>
      <showDescription>Halfway through his life according to the life expectancy calculator, Watson takes an audit of his time on earth in a new show which premieres in his spiritual home, Australia. His thirties have been eventful to say the least. At 40, his life is in the best shape in living memory… but one problem remains, and it really is a huge one. Spiritual enquiry meets high-octane observational comedy as Watson, as usual, attempts to cram a year of pathological overthinking into just under an hour's stand-up. Maybe we'll even solve the huge problem. Doubt it, though.&#xD;

      <artistImageType>jpg</artistImageType>
      <showDescription>After a massive sell-out season across Australia in 2019, Nazeem returns with his sixth solo stand up show 'Hussain That?'&#xD;
&#xD;
It's been a huge few years for Nazeem. You'd have seen his face pop up on Channel 7 in his own sketch series Orange Is The New Brown, or on his Netflix half-hour special, or perhaps you saw him on The Masked Singerafter which he became BFFs with Lindsay Lohan. Or maybe you took a selfie with Nazeem, literally as he was getting caught fare evading on public transport. What a tight ass.&#xD;
&#xD;
Whatever the case, don't miss your chance to see Nazeem do what he does best and loves most.&#xD;
&#xD;
Selling out shows across Australia, New Zealand, Edinburgh, London, China, Malaysia, Montreal and even Sri Lanka, Nazeem is a comedian at the top of his game. Twice nominated for a Helpmann Award for Best Comedy Performer, and twice winning an Australian Writers' Guild award for Best Sketch Comedy, you don't want to miss Nazeem in action.&#xD;

Edinburgh Fringe sell-out show 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 &amp;amp; 2019.&#xD;
This hilarious, sell-out, award winning, smash-hit show has already sold over half a million tickets worldwide and premieres at Canberra Theatre to help you enjoy Shakespeare responsibly.&#xD;
Shit-Faced Shakespeare is the hilarious blend of an entirely serious Shakespeare play with an entirely shit-faced actor. What could possibly go right? With a genuinely inebriated cast member chosen each night, no two shows are ever the same in this raucous, riotous, rampage through Shakespeare's greatest tragedy: Hamlet.&#xD;

      <showDescription>The Chaser's Charles Firth and The Shovel's James Schloffel take on the scourge of the modern era: experts and their experty expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
• Did you know that climate change graphs look very different indeed if you turn them upside down?&#xD;
• Have you ever noticed the alarming number of celebrities who have been vaccinated and then later died?&#xD;
• Did you know that over 99% of people who die in car crashes have eaten sultanas at some point in their life? And yet the government refuses to ban sultanas.&#xD;
&#xD;
Fresh from national tours playing to sell-out crowds across the country this show will alarm even the most level-headed. Charles and James take on the topics that others fear to take on for fear of looking like an idiot.&#xD;
&#xD;
And who knows where the night will go? You may end up joining Charles and James's own custom-built religion, and agreeing to give 10% of your future income to them. That could be fun!</showDescription>
