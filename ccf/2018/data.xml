Despite many changes, successive Coopers have never lost sight of Thomas Cooper's vision of providing value and quality in the form of a healthy beer for an appreciative public.

'A must see for anyone who loves a laugh'  ★★★★ Adelaide Advertiser

After selling out Canberra in 2017, Arj Barker returns for a special one-off encore performance.

As always, I start with the finest free-range topics, nurture them until they're brimming with wholesome hilarity, and ready for the tellin'. Remember, my cruelty-free jokes are ALWAYS tested on animals, and 100% goat-approved by the time you hear them. That's quality you can trust.

* may contain traces of nuts

Arj Barker is arguably Australia's favourite American comedian. In recent years, he has spent more time in our country than his own and has come to understand our culture perhaps better than we understand it ourselves. His stand-up is both insightful and pointed, like a mind-reading thumb tack, if there was one of those.

Brexit. Trump. No more Mary Berry on the Great British Bake Off. Things are looking bleak, so wouldn't it be better to just forget all about it? Comic maestro Stephen K Amos might not be able to provide bread to the hungry masses, but no one else is going to put on a better circus. Leave your problems behind for the evening in the company of the 'effusively charming' Amos and who knows? Maybe the world will seem just a little bit brighter.

EXTRA SHOW ADDED DUE TO PHENOMENAL DEMAND: MONDAY 19 MARCH 5:45PM

Presented by LiveNation

Every time you hear, "studies have shown" you know you're about to learn something ridiculous!
Studies have shown your dog is happier than your cat! Who cares! How about they give funding to scientists to come up with a way to eradicate the unibrow, or those weird thin white hairs you occasionally find attached to your face! Let's get some research done on what happens to your blood pressure when your kid keeps getting out of bed when you've tucked them in 20 f*cking times already!

Australia's Crown Prince of Comedy, Joel Creasey, has whored himself across Australian TV screens from comedy galas, panel shows, celebrity interviews and even the depths of the African jungle.
He is the protégé of the late great Joan Rivers, and this past year alone presided over commentary duties at Eurovision, released his first memoir, won GQ Comedian of the Year, made his debut in a TV drama. Oh… and played a slut on Neighbours.
So you better believe he is ready to rip back the curtain and fill you in on all the juicy behind the scenes action.
Strap yourselves in for a night with this blonde bombshell as he slices, dices, sasses and smashes celebrities, pop culture and himself.
As Joel's rule always stands… anyone not in the room… is a target!

A-List Entertainment Presents: Shit-faced Shakespeare (UK)

★★★★★ Broadway Baby ★★★★ Time Out ★★★★ Metro (UK) ★★★★ WhatsOnStage (UK) ★★★★ London Theatre

This multi-award winning, interactive, cult-hit show has already entertained over 170,000 audience members worldwide from Edinburgh to the USA and London's West End and is hitting Canberra as a part of a debut Australian Tour!

Shit-faced Shakespeare is the hilarious combination of an entirely serious Shakespeare play with an entirely Shit-faced actor. What could possibly go right? With a genuinely inebriated cast member chosen each night, no two shows are ever the same in this raucous, riotous, rampage through Shakespeare's greatest work: Romeo and Juliet.

a) smartphone b) keyboard c) wall/door/window d) a toe e) road rules f) the internet g) Christmas h) your mother's heart i) all of the above.
If you answered i)… please come to my show.
Why do we get angry? Should we be ashamed of ourselves? And will we be able to claim any insurance on that phone we biffed into traffic?
Claire Hooper examines the funny side of one of our darkest emotions in a tale of grand moral outrage and small, daily furies.
And no, you're not getting any money back for that phone.

Do you ever feel like you're the only normal one in your family?
Meet Josh Earl, because he feels your pain. After the sell-out success of last year's Oliver Up A Tree, the award-winning comedian is back to tell tales of a dad who can't read maps, a mum who can't be spoken to when her shows are on, a Nan who needs a lesson in table manners and a dog that burps bubbles.
It's family-friendly mayhem with songs, stand-up and cartoons, bound to have everyone in stitches.

'kind and intelligent, but is dotted with fart jokes, poo jokes, and a few jokes that only adults will understand. It is a higher level of storytelling energy and imagination that few parents will be able to match.' ★★★★ – The Age

Cal's made some awful decisions – relationships, jobs, the 90s. She's made some great ones as well, she just didn't realise at the time. People say that everything happens for a reason, but what if it's just a terrible reason? Can you really learn from your mistakes, or is hindsight just nostalgia for the path you didn't take? Cal's trying to make sense of everything she's ever done. Or she might just tell some jokes. You'll only know afterwards.

A new show of uproarious musical comedy from Australia's favourite bickering identical twins.

Settle in for hilarious songs that have seen them compared to Flight of The Conchord's, Tim Minchin and Bo Burnham, mixed with their trademark sibling rivalry banter. In 2017 the Stevenson's swept the world – selling out entire seasons everywhere from the Melbourne Comedy Festival to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival – and picking up a Best Comedy Nomination for the third year in a row at Perth FRINGEWORLD. After all that, you'd think they'd have started to get along. You'd be wrong.

'An absolute stand-out, one-of-the-best-moments-of-the-Fringe.' ★★★★★ The Fountain (Edinburgh)

'Hilarious. You will not regret it.' ★★★★1/2 Herald Sun (Melbourne)

'Their songs are side-bustingly hilarious.' ★★★★★ Melbourne Arts

Three-time Perth FRINGEWORLD Best Comedy Award Nominees, 2015, 2016, &amp; Runner-Up 2017.

Presented with the Melbourne International Comedy Festival
Everyone's favourite sardonic straight shooter Rich Hall returns to Canberra.

After sell-out shows in 2016 the cranky yank is back, bringing more of his trademark wit and caustic conversation.

Alongside top gongs at both Melbourne Comedy Festival and Edinburgh Fringe, Rich Hall has collected a legion of fans around the world. Through regular television appearances on QI and Have I Got News For You and his own BBC 4 documentaries, Hall cuts deep into the human condition in wry style.

An expert stand-up, musician and improviser, Rich Hall is a master of irony and the absurd. Do not miss this true festival legend doing what he does best – nimbly delivering line after line of on-point political observations and comic banter.

'Searing, smart and so funny it hurts.' ★★★★1/2 The Advertiser

'Hall is unrelenting – and brilliant.' ★★★★1/2 The Music

Winner: Barry Award 2013 Melbourne International Comedy Festival

      <showDescription>
In 2017 Becky saw a man on crutches trying to walk a big dog and has spent the entire year trying to write standup comedy that's funnier than that.
Becky has written for Emmy nominated show Please Like Me and last year she co-wrote Matt Okine's TV show The Other Guy for Stan. She was picked to create a web series for ABC's Fresh Blood as well as co-creating the popular online series share this for Comedy Central.
Last year she had a sold out run of shows nationally and overseas which was eventually filmed for ABC and just recently was chosen to perform at the prestigious JFL showcase at the Sydney Opera House.
Her show at the Canberra Comedy Festival is titled 'cute funny smart sexy beautiful' and is a nod to her notoriously low self esteem. Don't miss out on seeing her live at the Canberra Comedy Festival!

At the time of writing, this blurb is over two weeks late and we still have not named the show. So the show is obviously going to be quality. Be prepared for meticulously rehearsed material. We didn't bother with a picture either so here is cat riding a dog. Jez and Greg are the greatest comedians their friends know. Unless of course their friends know any other comedians, especially those who are better than Greg and Jez.

Pilot Season is an absurd show about the media featuring performances from Canberra's best comedic talent.

      <showDescription>Political Comedy. A slightly drunk TED talk. From Near Dead White Male Productions.

Who among us would be PM? No weekends, no job security, no…power. But with the position permanently vacant, it's time for someone to step up. Is that someone, Mark Swivel? Probably not. He's obviously unfit for public office, but that seems compulsory these days. Promising! His efforts to engage with politics as a young man were tragic – he is surely doomed to the fate of Kathy Worthington who, aged 9, everyone was sure was going to be PM. Didn't happen. But Swivel is deluded and determined to get this country to, um, come together. Everyone from the pearl divers of Broome to the beard oil wholesalers of Braddon! A tough gig. But, people of Austraya, you can do it! Join Mark as he launches his killer Ten Point Plan for A Country Worth Living In, using nothing but Venn Diagrams and Hula Hoops. Fully costed and as thought-through as anything in AusPol since Fightback. All funded by a flag tax. You might end up in his cabinet. Warning: this is a bi partisan show (at least bi-curious partisan).

Absurd, timely, oddly inspiring. Good to be with you!

'From politics to punctuation, pools and penis pumps, no topic is too random as he crafts together a very funny, but also surprisingly quite poignant show' – Meredith Walker, Blue Curtains Brisbane, on Swiv's last show, Dad. Joke

      <showDescription>From a young age, Matt's dad taught him how to get the most out of the slurpee machine. You gotta tap and shake the cup. Expel the air. Work it like a conga drum. Coconut oil is good for sexy massages but also to rub on your head if you are going bald and have nobody to massage. And don't fall down the flat-earth rabbit hole; you'll only go round in circles…These are the things our teachers never taught us.

It's been a massive 12 months for Matt Okine, you could not miss him in 2017 when he wrote and starred in his very own hit series "The Other Guy" on Stan along with hosting his own cooking show on ABC "Shortcuts to Glory" and touring the country with his live standup show. Don't miss seeing Matt Okine live in 2018.

What do you do when you come from a small country that has made international punchlines, not headlines? Well, you laugh along!

This is what Douglas Lim has done for most of his career in Malaysia, addressing all manner of issues with honest and candid humour. From racial idiosyncrasies to curious customs to unfathomable policies, Douglas has always made it a point to say it like it is.

Douglas starred in the long-running hit sitcom 'Kopitiam', has been coined 'The King of Malaysian Comedy' and was listed as one of the 'Top 10 Comedians in Asia' by Top 10 of Asia Magazine. His approachable and relaxed style is tinted with a distinctly Malaysian flavour, bringing a diverse cultural perspective to Australian audiences.

      <showDescription>Presented with the Melbourne International Comedy Festival
The Melbourne International Comedy Festival is on the hunt for Australia's funniest secondary school peeps for its annual Class Clowns comedy competition.

The Canberra heat will be held at 5pm Thursday 22 March, but contestants are also encouraged to participate below!

Teens in Years 9-12 (or between the ages of 14-18 years old) can now sign up for free to work alongside some of the festival's finest comic talent, polishing up their own original five minutes of stand- up, sketch or musical comedy for a real live public performance hosted by a professional comedian during Melbourne International Comedy Festival in April 2018.

Participants will battle it out for the prize of $1,500 for themselves and a $1,000 workshop package for their school.

From comedy workshops in schools to a national comedy competition, Class Clowns engages and inspires the young and funny to hone their potential. Last year hundreds of teens participated in Class Clowns with NSW's Daniel Reeve taking out the National gong.

Past participants include Joel Creasey, Rhys Nicholson, Aaron Chen and Tom Ballard.
