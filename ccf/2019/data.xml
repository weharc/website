<showDescription>
One brother has moved to Sydney, the other to Melbourne. Andrew and Danny Bensley are now catching up and swapping stories for your amusement in their new show: 2 Bensley 2 Furious.
 Hear about the latest family woes, Andrew's attempt at playing a super-hero, their Dad's apparent invincibility and more.
 
 With years of sold out shows in the Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney comedy festivals, behind them, join the comedic brothers on this glorified catch up for one night only! As only one of the boys is putting up the cash for this show, if you don't come you can see him in the sequel: 1 Furious Bensley.

<showDescription>
Have you always wanted a perfect body, with rock hard abs and buns of steel without ever getting out of bed? Imagine having enough confidence to get out of your car during a road rage incident that wasn't your fault, instead of apologising and cowardly driving off as quickly as you can.  If you have ever wanted to be so financially wealthy that you could pay Rupert Murdoch to drop his pants and perform a silly dance while singing in a high pitch voice, just for a laugh.
 
 Well in this one-hour show, Akmal will be asking the audience if they know how he can achieve these things.
 A life changing experience or your money back.

<showDescription>
Anthony has performed in sell-out Festival shows and is excited to be back at CCF with his new solo offering, 'Believe It.' 'Believe It.' (the show) is about Anthony's yearning for truth and  credibility. 'Believe it.' (the write-up) is about Anthony's personal quest to produce a less than or equal to, 150 word description for the purpose of festival admin.
 
 If you have to know what's gonna be in the show it's likely to include impersonations of his parents, a healthy dose of neuroses (if there is such a dose), stories, observations and act-outs.

<showDescription>
Hello, I'm Becky, and I'm a 29 year old woman which means I'm passionate about two things: getting every surface of the bathroom incredibly wet and blaming my mood and behaviour on the moon. In the past year I filmed a bunch of stuff for Comedy Central, did the Melbourne International Comedy Festival gala, filmed a pilot for the ABC, performed my solo show at the Sydney Opera House as part of the JFL comedy festival as well as some other stuff. I also got banned from twitter for making a joke about chopping the Prime Minister's head off, which is ridiculous because honestly, I don't even have the time! I have a friggin' show to perform! Anyway, um, support me?!

Chris once heard a bloke say: “If you cut the corners you get there quicker” when giving directions to a motorcyclist in Tasmania without a hint of sarcasm and realised she cuts corners all the time, just not on a motorbike. Fake tans, fake friends, fake news: If you take the shortcut the it's probably bogus – but you'll still get there. Probably.
 
 Chris Ryan's laconic take on passive aggressive co-workers, family and relationships earned her spots on Sydney Comedy Festival Showcase tours to Queensland and NSW, the Canberra Comedy Festival Gala, TEDxCanberra, Floriade Nightfest, the Fearless Comedy Gala and CanBRA Comedy Gala in 2018.
 
 "Chris was in total control from the moment she hit the stage. A comedian with a unique outlook and broad appeal." Justin Hamilton, Head Writer Show Me the Movie.

<artistImage>Daniel_Sloss-960x576-870x560</artistImage>
<showDescription>
Internationally acclaimed, award-winning Scottish stand-up star, Daniel Sloss returns to Canberra Comedy Festival with his new show, X. Brilliantly dark with razor-sharp wit and the ability to deftly spin a narrative, Sloss is a comedian who is “dirty, sweet and clever” (New York Times).
 
 Returning off the back of two recent Netflix specials, Sloss offers a slick and genuinely witty performance, taking on the often awkward and controversial topics delivered with “precision timing, perfectly-placed silence and unfettered confidence” (Herald Sun, Uk).
 
 At the age of only 27, he is regular on Conan O'Brian with a record 9 appearances, has sold out 11 consecutive Edinburgh Fringes seasons (being one of the biggest comedy ticket sellers for the last 8 years) and played 9 solo sold out seasons in London's West End as well as 3 seasons off-Broadway in New York.
 
 X is his 10th solo show and if you've not seen him live before, it's time to find out why he is fast becoming one of the world's biggest names in comedy!
 
 'Simply world class… Sloss skilfully weaves sensitive subject matter into a hilarious tapestry… intelligently and ironically calling out the hypocrisy of human nature' ★★★★ – Herald Sun, Australia
 'Dirty, sweet and clever' – New York Times
 'Hilarious… Sloss is a festival highlight. See him.' ★★★★1/2 – The Age, Australia
 'At 27, Scotland's Daniel Sloss has, incredibly, now racked up his tenth Fringe outing. Tackling taboos (death, grooming) has become his forte and this latest continues the trend. “X” is a stunner of a show.' ★★★★★ – Mail on Sunday, Edinburgh

<showTitle>The World Is Amazing and Everyone's A Winner</showTitle>
<artistImage>Daniel-Townes-NEW-960-x-576-870x560</artistImage>
<showDescription>
Daniel Townes returns with a brand new show about the current divide in our society, equality, fear-mongering, offence, Batman, and a load of other things that sound hilarious when you put the word comedy next to them.
 
 Townes pours 16 years of experience onstage into his dry, intelligent and brilliantly relatable comedy, with a laid-back charm that makes entertaining a room full of strangers look easy. Society's shortcomings and foibles – from the big questions of life through to the petty grievances of day to day existence – all are neatly excised by his sharp, razor-edged wit and rapid-fire delivery, guaranteeing a ferocious hit rate of punchlines-per-minute.
 
 As seen on ABC Comedy Next Gen and Comedy Up Late, and the Just For Laughs Australia Stand-up Series.
 
 “Daniel Townes is a small-name comedian with a big talent. It feels like you're sitting down with a mate, discussing the ridiculousness of life. Townes is genuinely funny, I highly recommend him to anyone tired of seeing big names coast on their reputations.”  - The Age
 
 “Pound for pound, one of the best Australian stand-ups going around. The fact that his name might not be familiar is entirely your fault. He is that good. It's like spending an hour with a mate who's funnier, warmer and more intelligent than the ones you've already got.” - GQ Magazine
 
 “Top-mark laughs, clever call-backs and acerbic social commentary.” - Herald Sun

Dave hasn't had a haircut since last year's Festival. His fringe is now a face curtain.
 
 What has prompted this radical change? Is it a crisis? Is he going through manopause?
 
 The only way to know the answers is to come along. Only your own ears and eyes can be trusted. Book now.

<showDescription>
It's hard to believe but Guy Montgomery hasn't always been perfect. While most people are gracious and empathetic from birth, this has not been Guy's path.
 
 White, straight, and from Christchurch, New Zealand it's been an existence lived in the fog of privilege, and in spite of frantically trying to outgrow his ignorance, there aren't many minorities Guy hasn't denigrated on the road to basic human decency. Embrace this rare opportunity to hear from someone unlearning the various blind spots that made him part of the problem before we were talking about it.

Strap in for a night of scandal and stories with Australia's reigning Crown Prince of Comedy.
 
 Joel Creasey has had quite the year. You may have seen him hosting Eurovision and Mardi Gras on SBS, or Take Me Out on Channel 7, his Famewhore special on Network 10 and as a team captain on Show Me The Movie. Or his worldwide Netflix stand-up special. Look, clearly he's pissed someone off over at Channel 9. He also bought a house and dates a supermodel. Slay! He's got it worked out, right? Oh you couldn't be more wrong. You know how behind every amazing Instagram photo you post are 100 that simply weren't Insta-worthy? Well, behind every one of these sparkling achievements is the unfiltered, chaotic and hilarious f**k ups that plague Joel's daily life and have become a staple of his stand-up act. So strap in for a night of filthy, dishy, dirty stories from Australia's showbiz darling!

Lightbulb Improv is Canberra's premiere improvised comedy troupe, performing monthly since 2016. Known for crafting comedy moments in an unscripted, lively and daring manner, the Lightbulb Players are tellers of stories and singers of songs. Their moto? To create fearless theatre that frees the mind, delights the intellect, and distills the meaning of life. Or, they'll at least suck on lemons...literally… just to make you laugh.
 
 Opening Canberra Unscripted Festival at the Street Theatre with Truth or Dare in both 2017 and 2018, this year the Lightbulb Players share their impromptu magic with the Canberra Comedy Festival.  Two teams square off in this seriously silly 'Truth or Dare' game show. Will skeletons be unleashed from the closet or heads dunked in water? Which team will reign supreme in this feast of theatrical combat?

<showDescription>
Luke Heggie threatened to quit stand up comedy, but after everyone he told of his plans cried inconsolably and clung to his ankles as he walked away, he decided that the world needs laughter. So he's back with another harsh but fair show about dickheads.
 
 If you own a circular beach towel and/or a set of square dinner plates, you do the reach-around at buffets to get an empty plate before you're in front of the food, you're one of those deluded losers who's friends with all his ex-girlfriends, you wear a t-shirt with the word “finisher” on it, you were the one responsible for hot nuts not being available in pubs anymore, you're neither a mechanic nor a toddler and yet you wear overalls, you need a performer to be some former eisteddfod winner who will tell you how to think and act in your everyday lives, the most impressive thing to you about a comedian is that “he didn't swear once!”, or you need your comedy to sound just like it did in a much happier era of your life, then this is not the show for you.
 
 No lowbreeds please.

<showTitle>Women Like Us</showTitle>
<showDescription>
Women Like Us comedians Mandy Nolan and Ellen Briggs are different from your usual comedians. For a start they're women. They're mothers. They're middle aged and they are country girls.
 
 With over 100 – mostly sold out - shows to their credit the girls have performed to packed houses at Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Sydney Comedy Festival's Enmore Theatre, Adelaide Fringe and Perth Festival, as well as taking their comedy stylings to halls, pubs, clubs and theatres around the countr.  In 2018 they released their book – titled Women Like Us – to rave reviews.
 
 Women Like Us isn't your regular stand up comedy show. This is as one review described it 'a two tena pad show'. These are untold laugh out loud women's stories, smack bang centre stage.  It's a show about women, by women, but the men love it.  “If you are a man that loves great comedy, you'll love this show.  If you aren't, then stay in the car” laughs Nolan.

<artistName>Nazeem Hussain</artistName>
<showTitle>Basic Idiot</showTitle>
<showDescription>
It's been a massive year for Nazeem. He became a Dad, his sketch show *Orange Is The New Brown* began airing on Ch 7, he recorded his first Netflix special, and was finally invited to speak at his high school assembly (Rex Hunt pulled out). But more than fatherhood itself, Nazeem is most excited about joking about these things AND MORE on stage!
 
 If you've never seen Nazeem, where have you been? Selling out shows across Australia, New Zealand, Edinburgh, London, China, Malaysia, Montreal &amp; even Sri Lanka – Nazeem is a comedian at the top of his game. Twice nominated for a Helpmann Award for Best Comedy Performer, you don't want to miss his 5th consecutive solo show.

 Sh!t-faced Shakespeare® is the genuinely hilarious combination of an entirely serious Shakespeare play with an entirely Sh!t-faced actor. What could possibly go right?

<artistName>Simon Bower</artistName>
<showTitle>Not Santa Claus Material</showTitle>
<showDescription>
Simon Bower was recently rejected for his dream job as a mall Santa, forcing him to return to his fall-back career in stand-up comedy.
 
 A staple of the local comedy scene for several years, Simon has performed in sold-out shows at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Canberra Comedy Festival and Adelaide Fringe Festival, charming those audiences with his goofy and disarmingly honest sense of humour.
 
 Now, in his first ever solo show, Simon Bower will have you in stitches while he shares why he feels uncomfortable around identical twins, his thoughts on how old is too old to be someone's “boytoy”, the worst possible thing to say at a funeral and of course, tells the one joke about Santa that the show's named after. He may not be Santa Claus material, but the enthusiasm and laughter he brings makes an evening with Simon Bower the gift that keeps on giving.

<showTitle>Pity Party</showTitle>
<showDescription>
Two friends decide to follow their dream of creating an amazing sketch show! But among the several costume changes, the squirting citrus, the '80s aerobics, and the magic mike strip routines…they realise their dream might be a little out of reach. It's comedy, it's burlesque, it's slap stick, it's heartfelt…it's harder than they thought. A sketch show for those who question what they are doing with their lives and then do it anyway.
 
 Sweaty Pits' debut show “Pity Party” was nominated for “Best Comedy” at the 2018 Melbourne Fringe Festival and won the “New Zealand Tour Ready Award” at the 2018 Sydney Fringe Festival…and now it's come home to Canberra!
 
 “Comic geniuses”– Across The Aisle
 
 “Sweaty Pits are on a f*king mission to pussy whip you into seeing the world with their unique brand of chaos and teach you a f*king thing about equality on the way.” – Sydney Arts Guide

Tanya's lived her adult life like a cowboy, doing whatever she wants but now she's back where she grew up, with her own family in tow, and looking down the barrel of caring for her elderly Italian parents only to realise this ride is wilder than the wild west!
 
 From dealing with scammers, telcos and buying a walker from Aldi on a specials day, this is a show about the chaos and absurdity affecting more and more people who are becoming a part of the sandwich generation!
 
 Drawing on the inspiration of the Good, The Bad and The Ugly and the music of Ennio Morricone this is what happens when a middle-aged cowboy tries to care for two old cowboys, only to realize that one of the greatest weapon in the fight for independence is belligerence!

<artistImage>Chasers_War-960x576-870x560</artistImage>
<showDescription>
Following sold-out runs in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, The War on History is based on the book from The Chaser Quarterly and The Shovel “The Completely True History of Australia”. It is, by far, the least reliable, but most hilarious account of Australian history.
 
 On 26 January 1788, a bunch of old white men arrived in Australia and started ruining it for everyone.
 
 240 years later, you can relive that experience by having a bunch of slightly younger white men ruin your night as they present sketches, pranks, quizzes and a 150 page Powerpoint presentation on all the best moments in Australian history.
 
 You'll be joined on this journey by Australia's least eminent historians, including The Chaser's Charles Firth and The Shovel's James Schloeffel. Plus there's also a very special guest star, who we cannot announce for reasons that will become apparent during the show.

<artistName>Three Blind Men</artistName>
<showTitle>Three Blind Men</showTitle>
<showDescription>
When society refuses to stop you succeeding, perhaps you'll find your own ways to fail…
 
 Life gave Chris Marlton, Nick Schuller and Taylor Coughtrie every opportunity to succeed but they are still finding ways to screw it up.Three Blind Men is the story of three clueless guys stumbling through what should have been a simple life. Through Taylor's daring dissections, Nick's amazing analysis, and Chris' fictional feasts, you'll learn about the economic feasibility of heaven, how to name crocodiles, and whether or not it's too easy to live. You'll pray at a digital church, find out if Rose from Titanic was a good person, and even solve Australia's gate-manufacturing crisis.
 
 Taylor Coughtrie is a young millennial with a poor work ethic and all the answers. He'll entertain you, probably annoy you, but definitely introduce you to a different way of thinking about life, and maybe even force a few audience members to look in the mirror uncomfortably. Taylor guides you through the thought processes of a self-proclaimed 'degenerate genius.' He's performed in sold out shows at the Canberra Comedy Festival, a prison, and came third place at the RAW Comedy state final.
 
 Nick Schuller has the answers to the questions nobody asked. Which football club would make the best terrorist organisation? What was JFK's most used hashtag? How can we improve Australia's gate manufacturing crisis? Nick's comedy sees him apply his sharp analytical mind to subjects that definitely don't need to be analysed. The result is a hilarious deep dive into the minutiae of everyday life. Affable, engaging and a little bizarre, Nick delivers a unique brand of stand-up that is sure to please.
 
 Do polar bears fly on planes? Can alligators play piano? And when has a little bit of garbage really hurt anyone? Chris Marlton brings a mixture of mind-bending one liners and engaging and laugh-inducing stories that have to be heard to be believed; get in on the ground floor and experience these hilarious fever dreams while you can.
 
 Together they are THREE BLIND MEN – a insightful, imaginative and always funny show that you'll be thinking about for weeks to come. Don't miss out!

<showTitle>DISRUPTION</showTitle>
<showDescription>
DISRUPTION is the story of one man who feels like everything he does is way harder than it should be. It's like the whole world has decided to slide sticks in his wheels whenever it looks like he's heading downhill. But now he's turned the tables. Now Tom is the DISRUPTION.
 
 Tom smashed the Canberra Comedy Festival to bits with his previous shows A Whole Lot Faster and Are You For Real? and only put it back together just so he can smash it again. Full of Tom's trademark convoluted rants and over-the-top physicality, don't miss one of Canberra's favourite comedians do what he does best.

<showDescription>
Zoë has been on hiatus. Sort of. For the past six years, she's been a terrible male comedian with a neckbeard called Dave, winning stacks of awards and tons of great reviews. Whatever.
 
 Now, she's scraped off the neckbeard and is BAAAAACK… as herself.
