If Aunty Donna succeeds, I have promised to surprise them with a mystery, web slinging guest!

Come and see if Broden, Zach and Mark are up for the task!

      <showDescription>Chris Ryan had enough time in lockdown to complain about how filthy her bedside table was but not enough time to clean it. She lives most of her life with the stance of an inmate that's about to be shanked – some people knit, Chris scans for threats. Her special skill is making life harder than it needs to be. Still, others are worse off, so she can't complain.

Or, more recently, his award-winning podcast 'Sizzletown' and his low-scoring appearances on 'Have You Been Paying Attention?'.

      <showDescription>When Tripod started doing their thang back in, like, 1874, there wasn't much of a cabaret comedy scene in Australia. Music comedians in general wouldn't know an E flat major if it sat up in their porridge. Then Tripod penny-farthinged along and changed all that with their pig-headed insistence on being an awesome music show as well as a complete idiot patrol. Don't believe me slash us? Go see them at the Canberra Theatre. I/we'm tellin' ya, it's a complete rush seeing this combo of gorgeous harmonies, musical vision and complete spannerhead-ism. You will come away elated. No bull.

      <showDescription>Big and small moments shape us. Some we choose, some are chosen by others, and some just happen. Like the first day at school (pictured) when Mum made you wear a skivvy under your XXL shirt, to when you had to use the only phone in the house (circa 1989) in earshot of your entire family to talk to your high school crush. We are the sum of these moments and our nearest and dearest love to remind us that we have not always been the awesome humans we think we are.

This show will delight with loveable shy country lad qualities (also pictured) and a hilarious take on life's big and small moments.

And Wen Su, the man who holds the record for the most jokes about his name.

      <showDescription>Hamish Hudson returns to the Canberra Comedy Festival in an all new show, with all new songs. Because it's an all new show.

As one of the country's top musical comedians, he has the ability to take you on a delightful journey from world class song writing to the cheekier-side of profanities.

Hamish's music is clever, simple, poignant and everything non-pc, leaving audiences wanting more and singing his ridiculously ear worming lyrics for days.

His refreshingly honest persona, musicality and hilarious take on life culminate in a show not to be missed.

Trish Hurley peaked in Primary School, since then she has lived a life worth poking fun at. Tanya Losanno has performed solo comedy shows around Australia and is now trying to be a dutiful daughter to her elderly Italian parents. Jacqui Richards has had a rocky career with too many regrets and too few boundaries. Midwife Sarah Stewart snapped on her rubber gloves years ago and has seen it all.

In 2010 the world was in a sorry state. Fast-forward 12 years and everything's still going downhill. Stephen has had his own share of highs and lows too. And when the world gives him lemons, he adds gin, tonic, ice and a healthy dose of humour. So forget the divisions and discord, and immerse yourself in an hour of bridge-building laughter to welcome the (hopeful) end of lockdowns!</showDescription>

      <showDescription>THREE TIME 'BEST COMEDY' NOMINEES 

AS SEEN ON THE MELBOURNE INTERNATIONAL COMEDY FESTIVAL SUPERSHOW

For a decade, critically acclaimed musical comedy duo The Stevenson Experience have toured their hilarious songs all over the world. They've also bickered and badgered each other every step of the way.

Now they're returning to Canberra with the show they couldn't do last year because of a worldwide pandemic. That's okay, it just means they had another year to perfect their jokes. There'll be side-splitting songs, sharp stand-up, and classic sibling rivalry banter.

This show sold out around the country in 2020 and 2021, come and see the final performance in the biggest theatre The Stevos have ever played! Just like Mum and Dad said when the second twin popped out: better late than never.

Let's not waste words. Hilarious songs – identical twins – classic banter – an hour of non-stop laughs. Come and find out what all the fuss is about.

"Nothing can prepare you for The Stevenson Experience, an absolute highlight of this years fringe that had the audience in stitches" ★★★★½ Adelaide Advertiser.

"An absolute stand-out, one of the best moments of the Festival" ★★★★★ Fountain (UK).

"Hilarious! You will not regret it" ★★★★½ Herald Sun.
