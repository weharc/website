Welcome to the Canberra Comedy Festival app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Craig Harvey. The app is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (e.g. your own festival schedule) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.
